# Logic-and-Numerical-Computation-Exercises-in-MATLAB
Developed a series of MATLAB exercises focused on core principles of numerical computation. The project involved applying numerical methods to solve mathematical problems with attention to accuracy and efficiency. Throughout the work, I produced a detailed explanatory report that demonstrated the reasoning behind each solution.
